# Note Taking Application, using Express.js

## Desription

This application can be used to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js back-end and will save and retrieve from a JSON file that is the database. 

Beginning this project given all front-end code, I was able to focus soley on understanding the back-end connections and processing for saving and fetching data. Working through the many challenges I faced in building this I have happily and significantly improved my understanding of backend developement in several key areas, including: routing, handling http requests, serving static files, data persistence with file systems, RESTful API design, usage of Middleware, error handling, server startup& listening, data flow, and UUID for unique idintifiers.

## Usage

As a user of this application, I find myself with a lot of thoughts that I would liek to be able to organize and save digitally. With this app I am able to title each of my notes and type as much or a little into each as I want. If, while I am writing a note, I decide I would like to erase everything and start over I can simply select the 'clear form' button on the screen. Once I am satisfied with the note I have written, I can save it with the 'save note' button. I am always able to view the titles of my saved notes in a bar on the left of my screen, and if I select one of these notes it opens up for me to read. If I would like to delete a note I just need to select the trashcan icon for it.
